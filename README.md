# How to Build and Deploy a Debugging APK for Android ðŸ“±

If you're developing an app using Capacitor, you can easily build and run your app on Android for debugging. Here's a step-by-step guide to building and installing a debugging APK.

---

### âœ… **Requirements**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

-   **Node.js & npm**
    
-   **Android Studio** with SDK and emulator or a physical device
    
-   **Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or higher)**
    

---

### ðŸ§© **Setup and Build Steps**

Follow these steps to set up your app and build the APK:

1.  **Build your frontend app:**
    
    Run the following command to build your frontend code:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    
2.  **Install Capacitor CLI and Core packages**  
    If you havenâ€™t installed them yet, run:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
    ```
    
3.  **Initialize Capacitor**  
    If you havenâ€™t initialized Capacitor in your project, do so with:
    
    ```bash
    npx cap init
    ```
    
    *Note: If you see an error regarding `capacitor.config.ts`, simply delete it before running this command.*
    
4.  **Add the Android platform**  
    Add Android support to your project with:
    
    ```bash
    npx cap add android
    ```
    
5.  **Sync your assets and configuration**  
    Sync the latest web assets and configurations to your native Android project:
    
    ```bash
    npx cap sync android
    ```
    
6.  **Open your Android project in Android Studio**  
    Open the Android project using:
    
    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```
    

---

### ðŸ›  **Build and Run APK in Android Studio**

1.  **Wait for Gradle sync**  
    Once Android Studio is open, allow Gradle to sync.
    
2.  **Connect your device or start the emulator**  
    Connect an Android device via USB or start an emulator.
    
3.  **Build the APK**
    
    -   Click the **Run** button (the green triangle) to run your app on the device/emulator.
        
    -   Alternatively, you can go to **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)** to generate the APK.
        
4.  **Install and Run the APK**  
    Once the APK is generated, you can either install it on your device or run it directly from the emulator.
    

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Tips**

-   The APK generated by these steps is a **debug build**, ideal for testing and debugging your app.
    
-   If you're preparing for **production**, make sure to configure signing keys and build a **release APK**.
    
-   For more in-depth instructions, check out the official **Capacitor Android Guide**.
